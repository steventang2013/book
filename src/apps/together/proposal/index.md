# Proposal

## Team Members

Steven Tang
Brooke Robinson
Connor McGuinness 
Christopher Fanning

## Ideation

These ideation questions are the same as before. Your answers should represent
the integration of creative ideas from every team member.

* What is the name of your app?

Music Together

* What collaborative activity can people do together using your app?

Individuals and/or groups can curate a musical masterpiece! We allow users to share, collaborate with friends, and update their musical piece in real time, much like Google Docs.

* What is the ideal number of concurrent users (must be at least 10 but no more than 40)?

The ideal number of users would be <= 10. However, any number of people can collaborate on a piece. This is only a precaution to avoid having people stepping over each other.

* What skills do people need in order to do this activity?

Being able to read notes, and having prior knowledge of playing musical instruments would be beneficial. However, this app can serve as a learning tool for music as well.

* Is this activity for fun or for something practical?

For enjoyment of course! However, if you curate a masterful musical piece from this app, you own sell or redistribute the music.

* How can a person see what everyone else is doing?

Notes are added in real time, so you will be able to see changes made directly by another collaborator.

* How can a person see the most recent result of everyone's collaborative effort?

Simply open up the project where everyone's collaborative effort is in. As previously stated, everything should be updated in real time.

* What can an admin see (i.e., God's mode)?

Admins should be able to see every user's status (online/offline, number of projects, etc.), and also have the read/write privileges for all musical projects.

## Contributions

For each person on the team, jot down a list of ideas credited to that person.
It's okay to credit multiple people for the same idea. The rationale of this
section of the proposal is to demonstrate that everyone on the team contributes
useful ideas.

* Steven Tang
  * Add chat for easier collaboration
  * Rating system for music
* Brooke Robinson
  * Original Music Together idea
  * Concurrency for editing music
* Connor McGuinness 
  * Implementing multiple instruments
  * Finding Friends
* Christopher Fanning
  * Pause - play for musical score
  * Preview of instrumental keys for easier usability

## Plan

A reasonable way to implement a functional prototype of your together app
is to build upon the service-matching app (i.e. uber). Discuss what additional
efforts may be required from your team to develop the together app.

* What existing components of the uber app your team can reuse?

Login portion would probably be helpful for both users and admins.

* What new components and features your team may need to build?

Almost everything else - like curation of music, real time collaboration, auto saving, musical score association, etc.

* What new skills your team will still need to acquire?

Music (for some of us) and perhaps studying readers writers problem for concurrency. We may also need to understand how to integrate
music into an application without messing up the musical scores.

## What's Next?

This is a preliminary proposal. Next week, your team will receive feedback and
will work on building a _mockup_ of this app. The week after that, your team
will start implementing the app.
